- The syntax of a request handler function in Express follows the pattern:
    ```js
    app.METHOD(path, [middleware], handler)
    ```
- A breakdown of each component:
    - `app`: This refers to the Express application instance.
    - `METHOD`: This represents an HTTP method, such as **get**, **post**, **put**, **delete**, etc. It corresponds to the HTTP verb for which the request handler function should be invoked.
    - `path`: This specifies the **URL path (route)** for which the request handler function should be called. It can be a string representing a specific path or a pattern using route parameters, wildcards, or regular expressions.
    - `middleware` (optional): You can specify one or more middleware functions that will be executed before the request handler function. Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects and can perform tasks such as authentication, data parsing, logging, etc.
    - `handler`: This is the request handler function that will be called when a matching HTTP request is received. It takes **two parameters**: **req (the request object)** and **res (the response object)**. Inside the handler function, you can access information about the request using **req object**, process it, and send a response back to the client using the **res object**.
-  Example of a simple request handler:
    ```js
    app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    // Request handling logic
    res.send('Hello, users!');
    });
    ```
